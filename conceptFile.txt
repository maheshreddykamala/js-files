1. The primitive types like boolean, number, string can be either primitive or an object depending on the way they were created.
ex:   
a. let number = 23;
b. let number1 =Number(100);
-- The number and number1 are primitives. There "typeof" is "number"
c.let number2 = new Number(100);
d.let number3 =  new Object(90);
e. let number4 =Object(45);
-- The number2 and number3 are objects. There "typeof" is "obect".
